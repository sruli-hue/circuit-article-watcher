# The Circuit article watcher

Posts every newly published article from The Circuit (circuit.news) to a Slack
channel as a link (which Slack unfurls into a preview), within a few minutes of
publish.

Runs 24/7 as a GitHub Actions workflow — it does **not** depend on any personal
machine being on. It reads the public circuit.news WordPress REST API, so no
login or cookie is needed.

Sibling of the Jewish Insider and eJewishPhilanthropy watchers; this one is
independent (its own repo, pinger, Slack webhook, and state).

## How it works

- `.github/workflows/poll.yml` runs `poll.py`, triggered by an external
  cron-job.org pinger (via the `workflow_dispatch` API) every few minutes. A
  `*/15` GitHub `schedule` is a laggy fallback if the pinger stops.
- `poll.py` fetches the 20 most recent posts and Slacks any it hasn't seen.
- Seen post IDs are stored in `watcher_state.json`, committed back each run.
- The Slack webhook is the `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` repository secret.

## First run

On the first run (no `watcher_state.json` yet) it records current posts as a
baseline and posts a single "watcher is live" message — it does not backfill.

## Local test

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="https://hooks.slack.com/services/..." python poll.py
```
